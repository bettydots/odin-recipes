		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			A cheesy delight of eggful proportions
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>3 Large Eggs</li>
			<li>1 tbsp Milk, or as needed</li>
			<li>Salt and Pepper</li>
			<li>2 tbsb Butter</li>
			<li>1/4 Cup Shredded Emmentaler Cheese</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Whisk eggs in a bowl; add milk and season with salt and white pepper. Whisk until egg mixture is foamy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
			<li>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in egg mixture and swirl the skillet, so the bottom is evenly covered with egg. Cook until egg starts to set, about 1 minute. Lift edges with a spatula and tilt the skillet so uncooked egg can flow towards the bottom of the skillet to set. Repeat until no visible liquid egg remains.</li>
			<li>Carefully flip omelette; cook until warmed through, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese down the middle of omelette; fold in half. Cook until cheese is melted, about 20 seconds. Slide omelette onto a plate.</li>
